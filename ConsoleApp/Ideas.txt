Things to test/do

- HttpResponseMessage implements IDisposable so it should probably be treated as such with usings
- Initialise or set the BaseUrl for the injected http client
- Use streams for requests instead of StringContent for message contents
- Use streams for responses instead of ReadAsStringAsync
